            <div class="academicskills">
                <p> A bulk of my studeis during my time here at Michigan have been very programming and math oriented. When I first got here this classes seemed to work, but the further along in my degree I get I realize they are my passion. These subject matters are something I want to do for the rest of my life and I am so excited to get a job in these fields.</p>

            <div class="sports">
                <p> Tennis has grown to be my favorite sport on the entire planet. I did not start playing tennis until the 8th grade, but once I started I was hooked. I went from picking up a racket in 8th grade to playing the state championship 4 years later, which is a tetsement on how many hours I put in during that time span.</p>

            <div class="hobbies">
                <p>Ping Pong and lacrosse are also two activiteies I thoroughly enjoy. I played lacrosse all four years of highschool. Though I diod not take it all that sertious, I still really enjoyed all the years on the team and will still occcasionaly play from time to time. I picked up a new found hobby this year in ping pong because my college house has one this year which has been very fun to pick up and compliments tennis nicely.</p>
