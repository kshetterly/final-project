            <h2 class="Degree">Academic Career</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Kagan Shetterly and I am currently a Junior in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. Within the school of Information, I am on the Inofrmation Analysis Track. I often get the question what types of classes I take for the Information Analysis Track as as the name is very descriptive and nor are the names of the classses on my transcript.
              Many of of my classes are object oriented programming coourses using Python and it's various libraries. The best way I could describe my degree would be a mixture of programming, mathematics, and statistics with a sprinkle of web design. This is my first semester in the school of Information  and I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in my courses so far.
              I was very confused in the direction I wanted to take my academic and professional career before this semester, but I think I have really found my passion and place ever since the beginning of this semester.

            <h3 class="Intern">Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>My passion for programming and mathematics began in high school and have truly taken off during my 2+ years at the University of Michigan. I hope to apply this interest to financial and strategic business based data. I believe that the experience I have gained through opportunities with Sift and attending the University of Michigan  have provided me with all of the skills necessary for this position. While working with Sift, a startup Saas software company, I created python notebooks  that consisted of hundreds of lines of Python code. 
              I spearheaded and resolved many business metrics issues pertaining to industry standard Saas software analytics that are important to company growth. After doing some of the metrics by hand, I then began to automate them in Python for the company to use for years to come. 
              I have also recently begun working with database management in my courses, where I am learning how to manipulate real-world data with Pandas and SQL in a way that is more easily consumed and has more meaningful representation â€” a new challenge that I am excited to take on. I have also quickly learned how to program with HTML and CSS where I work with a fast paced group for the purpose of learning how to build out and style websites.
